    <h1>Hello there!</h1>
    <p>A warm welcome and big thanks for participating in my research project.<p>
    <p>As you might know, all Bachelor students are required to set up a thesis project at the end of their study. The subject of which may be chosen freely, as long as it is somewhat relevant within their field.</p>
